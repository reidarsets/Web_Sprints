    <h1>Protocols</h1>

            <p>Protocol</p>
            <p>A data transfer protocol is an established set of rules or interface conventions that defines the exchange of data between different 
                level programs. These rules provide a uniform way to communicate messages and handle errors. Signal is used to control the connection - for example, 
                set up, forward, disconnect. Examples of protocols: RTSP, SIP. For data transfer, protocols such as RTP are used.
                Network protocol is a set of rules and actions (sequence of actions) that allows connection and data exchange between two or more devices connected to the network.
                Different protocols of the type describe only different sides of one connection. The names "protocol" and "protocol stack" also refer to the software that implements the protocol.
                New protocols for IETF definition, other protocols - IEEE or ISO. ITU-T deals with telecommunication protocols and formats.
                The most common classification system for network protocols is the so-called OSI model, according to which protocols are divided into 7 layers according 
                to their purpose - from physical (formation and recognition of electrical or other signals) to application (application programming interface for transferring applications).
                Network protocols prescribe the rules for the operation of computers that are connected to the network. They are built on a multilevel principle. A protocol of some level 
                defines one of the technical rules of communication. Currently, the network model OSI (Open System Interconnection - open open systems, OSI) is used for network protocols.
                The OSI model is a 7-layer logical model of how a network operates. </p>

            <p>HTTP</p>
            <p>This is a list of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) response status codes. Status codes are issued by a server in response to a client's 
                request made to the server. It includes codes from IETF Request for Comments (RFCs), other specifications, and some additional codes used in 
                some common applications of the HTTP. The first digit of the status code specifies one of five standard classes of responses. The message phrases 
                shown are typical, but any human-readable alternative may be provided. Unless otherwise stated, the status code is part of the HTTP/1.1 standard (RFC 7231).
                The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains the official registry of HTTP status codes.
                All HTTP response status codes are separated into five classes or categories. The first digit of the status code defines the class of response, 
                while the last two digits do not have any classifying or categorization role.</p>

        <div class="subtopic">
            <p>HTTPS</p>
            <p>HTTPS is not a separate protocol. This is plain HTTP, running over SSL and TLS encrypted transport mechanisms. It provides protection against sniffing 
                and man-in-the-middle attacks based on listening to a network connection, provided that encryption tools are used and the server certificate is verified and trusted.
                By default, HTTPS URL uses TCP port 443 (for insecure HTTP - 80). To prepare a web server to handle https connections, the administrator must obtain and install a public 
                and private key certificate for that web server in the system. TLS uses both an asymmetric encryption scheme (for generating a shared secret) and symmetric (for exchanging 
                data encrypted with a shared key). The public key certificate confirms that this public key belongs to the owner of the site. The public key certificate and the public key 
                itself are sent to the client when the connection is established; the private key is used to decrypt messages from the client.
                It is possible to create such a certificate without contacting a certification authority. Such certificates are signed with the same certificate and are called self-signed. 
                Without verifying the certificate in some other way (for example, calling the owner and checking the checksum of the certificate) such use of HTTPS is susceptible to a middleman attack.</p>

            <p>DNS</p>
            <p>DNS is a global system for translating IP addresses to human-readable domain names. When a user tries to access a web address like “example.com”, 
                their web browser or application performs a DNS Query against a DNS server, supplying the hostname. The DNS server takes the hostname and resolves 
                it into a numeric IP address, which the web browser can connect to. A component called a DNS Resolver is responsible for checking if the hostname is 
                available in local cache, and if not, contacts a series of DNS Name Servers, until eventually it receives the IP of the service the user is trying to reach, 
                and returns it to the browser or application. This usually takes less than a second.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subtopic">
            <p>IP</p>
            <p>An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.
                An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.
                Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) defines an IP address as a 32-bit number. However, because of the growth of the Internet and the depletion of available IPv4 addresses, 
                a new version of IP (IPv6), using 128 bits for the IP address, was standardized in 1998.
                IPv6 deployment has been ongoing since the mid-2000s.
                IP addresses are written and displayed in human-readable notations, such as 172.16.254.1 in IPv4, and 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1 in IPv6. The size of the routing prefix of the address
                is designated in CIDR notation by suffixing the address with the number of significant bits, e.g., 192.168.1.15/24, which is equivalent to the historically used subnet mask 255.255.255.0.</p>
